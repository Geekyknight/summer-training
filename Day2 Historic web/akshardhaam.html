    <p style="background-color: bisque;">Swaminarayan Akshardham is a Hindu temple and spiritual-cultural campus in
        Delhi, India. The temple is close to
        the border with Noida. Also referred to as Akshardham Temple or Akshardham Delhi, the complex displays millennia
        of traditional and modern Hindu culture, spirituality, and architecture. Inspired by Yogiji Maharaj and created
        by Pramukh Swami Maharaj, it was constructed by BAPS.[2] It is the world's second-largest BAPS Hindu temple,
        following Akshardham, New Jersey, in the United States.

        The temple was officially opened on 6 November 2005 by Pramukh Swami Maharaj in the presence of A. P. J. Abdul
        Kalam, Manmohan Singh, L.K Advani and B.L Joshi.[3][4] The temple, at the centre of the complex, was built
        according to the Vastu shastra and Pancharatra shastra.

        In Swaminarayan Akshardham, similar to its predecessor Swaminarayan Akshardham in Gandhinagar, Gujarat, the main
        shrine is the focal point and maintains the central position of the entire complex. There are various exhibition
        halls which provide information about the life and work of Swaminarayan. The designers of the complex have
        adopted contemporary modes of communication and technology to create the various exhibition halls.[5]

        The complex features an abhishek mandap, Sahaj Anand water show, a thematic garden, and three exhibitions namely
        Sahajanand Darshan (Hall of Values), Neelkanth Darshan (an IMAX film on the early life of Swaminarayan as the
        teenage yogi, Nilkanth), and Sanskruti Darshan (cultural boat ride). According to Swaminarayan Hinduism, the
        word Akshardham means the abode of Swaminarayan and believed by followers as a temporal home of God on
        earth.[6][7]</p>
