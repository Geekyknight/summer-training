    <p>The Qutb Minar, also spelled Qutub Minar and <b>Qutab Minar</b> , is a minaret and victory tower comprising the
        Qutb
        complex, which lies at the site of Delhi's oldest fortified city, Lal Kot, founded by the Tomar Rajputs.[3] It
        is a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the Mehrauli area of <i>South Delhi,
        </i> India.[4][5] It was mostly built between
        1199 and 1220, contains 399 steps, and is one of the most-frequented heritage spots in the city.[6][7][4] After
        defeating Prithviraj Chauhan, the last Hindu ruler of Delhi before the Ghurid conquest of the region,[8][9]
        Qutab-ud-din Aibak initiated the construction of the victory tower, but only managed to finish the first level.
        It was to mark the beginning of Islamic rule in the region. Successive dynasties of the Delhi Sultanate
        continued the construction, and, in 1368, Firuz Shah Tughlaq rebuilt the top parts and added a cupola.[10]

        It can be compared to the 62-metre all-brick Minaret of Jam in Afghanistan, of c.1190, which was constructed a
        decade or so before the probable start of the Delhi tower.[11] The surfaces of both are elaborately decorated
        with inscriptions and geometric patterns. The Qutb Minar has a shaft that is fluted with "superb stalactite
        bracketing under the balconies" at the top of each stage.[12][13][14] In general, minarets were slow to be used
        in India and are often detached from the main mosque where they exist.[15]

        In recent years, the Qutub Minar has been illuminated for special occasions involving international relations.
        In September 2023, the monument was lit up in the colours of the Mexican flag to commemorate Mexico's 213th
        Independence Day, an event that was acknowledged and appreciated by the Embassy of Mexico in India.[16]
        Similarly, on October 30, the Qutub Minar was illuminated with the Turkish flag to commemorate the 100th
        anniversary of the Republic of Turkey, an occasion that received special attention from the Turkish Embassy in
        New Delhi</p>
