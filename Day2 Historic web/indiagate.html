    <p style=" justify-content: center; flex: 1;">The India Gate (formerly known as All India War Memorial) is a war
        memorial located near the Rajpath (officially
        called Kartavya path) on the eastern edge of the "ceremonial axis" of New Delhi. It stands as a memorial to
        74,187 soldiers of the Indian Army who died between 1914 and 1921 in the First World War, in France, Flanders,
        Mesopotamia, Persia, East Africa, Gallipoli and elsewhere in the Near and the Far East, and the Third
        Anglo-Afghan War. 13,300 servicemen's names, including some soldiers and officers from the United Kingdom, are
        inscribed on the gate.[2] Designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, the gate evokes the architectural style of the ancient
        Roman triumphal arches such as the Arch of Constantine in Rome, and later memorial arches; it is often compared
        to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, and the Gateway of India in Mumbai.

        Following the Bangladesh Liberation war in 1972, a structure consisting of a black marble plinth with a reversed
        rifle, capped by a war helmet and bounded by four eternal flames, was built beneath the archway. This structure,
        called Amar Jawan Jyoti (Flame of the Immortal Soldier), has since 1971 served as India's tomb of the unknown
        soldier. India Gate is counted amongst the largest war memorials in India and every Republic Day, the Prime
        Minister visits the Gate to pay their tributes to the Amar Jawan Jyoti, following which the Republic Day parade
        starts. India Gate is often a location for civil society protests, and is popular with tourists.</p>
